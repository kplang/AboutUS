**KP-LANG { Kevell Programming Language } - Author - KarthiK**

3V build Process -  "Assembly-level control + Pythonic simplicity + LLM/AI superpowers all inside a single language that works across bare-metal boards, edge devices, Linux, RTOS, and even cloud."

kp is a new language blending Python's simplicity and C's performance mindset, designed for scripting, embedded automation, and AI/ML.

ðŸš€ Features
Easy-to-read syntax (Python-inspired)

First-class support for automation, ML, and embedded

Extendable interpreter (pure Python backend)

Future support for AI-native constructs & microcontroller DSL

Core KP Goals for Embedded:

Feature Purpose âœ… Low-level access (memory, registers, IO) For bare-metal embedded systems (like Assembly/C) âœ… Pythonic clean syntax Easy to learn, fast to write âœ… GPIO / UART / I2C / SPI / PWM / ADC / Interrupts Full embedded interface support âœ… RTOS / bare-metal compatible runtime Run without Linux (on ARM, RISC-V, ESP32, etc.) âœ… Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) Write KP once, deploy on any board âœ… Tiny ML + LLM support Inference-ready language âœ… Flashable interpreter binary Run KP natively like MicroPython âœ… LLM integration with KP syntax Imagine: llm.ask("What's the temperature trend?") on a sensor node ðŸ˜®

Environment Support Raspberry Pi Full hardware + Linux syscall support ESP32 (bare-metal / RTOS) GPIO, WiFi, BLE, Flash, ADC etc. STM32 / ARM Cortex-M Via C interop or generated bytecode Linux systems File, socket, shared memory, /dev/* Cloud or local LLMs Text+voice AI inference integration

ðŸ“¦ Example
x = 10
print(x + 5)

def greet(name):
    print("Hi, " + name)

greet("kp")
