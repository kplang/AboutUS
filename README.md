**KP Language - Vision & Purpose
🚀 Mission:
To create a next-gen programming language that:

Combines Python's simplicity with C/Assembly-level control

Targets embedded systems

Supports AI/ML, LLMs, sensor I/O, and hardware control

Offers cross-language interoperability (Python, Node.js, C, Java, Go, Scala)

**

3V build Process -  "Assembly-level control + Pythonic simplicity + LLM/AI superpowers all inside a single language that works across bare-metal boards, edge devices, Linux, RTOS, and even cloud."

kp is a new language blending Python's simplicity and C's performance mindset, designed for scripting, embedded automation, and AI/ML.

EX : 

1. Non-Coders on Embedded Boards (via LLM + KP)
🔌 Plug sensors or devices into Raspberry Pi, ESP32, or custom boards

🎙 Use voice commands like:

“Read temperature from sensor every 10 seconds and log it.”

✅ KP interprets + LLM generates cross-language code on the fly

🚀 Result: code runs on embedded boards without the user writing a single line

🧠 KP voice+LLM interface upgrades functionality like:

“Add WiFi OTA update to the C code block”

🎯 Result: Teams maintain existing code, KP wraps upgrades seamlessly




🚀 Features
Easy-to-read syntax (Python-inspired)

First-class support for automation, ML, and embedded

Extendable interpreter (pure Python backend)

Future support for AI-native constructs & microcontroller DSL

Core KP Goals for Embedded:

Feature Purpose ✅ Low-level access (memory, registers, IO) For bare-metal embedded systems (like Assembly/C) ✅ Pythonic clean syntax Easy to learn, fast to write ✅ GPIO / UART / I2C / SPI / PWM / ADC / Interrupts Full embedded interface support ✅ RTOS / bare-metal compatible runtime Run without Linux (on ARM, RISC-V, ESP32, etc.) ✅ Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) Write KP once, deploy on any board ✅ Tiny ML + LLM support Inference-ready language ✅ Flashable interpreter binary Run KP natively like MicroPython ✅ LLM integration with KP syntax Imagine: llm.ask("What's the temperature trend?") on a sensor node 😮

Environment Support Raspberry Pi Full hardware + Linux syscall support ESP32 (bare-metal / RTOS) GPIO, WiFi, BLE, Flash, ADC etc. STM32 / ARM Cortex-M Via C interop or generated bytecode Linux systems File, socket, shared memory, /dev/* Cloud or local LLMs Text+voice AI inference integration

📦 Example
x = 10
print(x + 5)

def greet(name):
    print("Hi, " + name)

greet("kp")
